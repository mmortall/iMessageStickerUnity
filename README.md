## First, you need to Configurate the Sticker Pack.
You do this by selecting the Configurate menu item from within Unity.
This will create the StickerPack asset for you if it is not set up yet and then select it.

## Then you can specify the settings for the sticker pack.

## Changed for Mmortall

I've removed Resource folder. Now stickers will not be added into build because there they are hard licked in StackersConfig located in resource folder. Now they not. 
I also added define to turn off this extension. Use WITHOUT_STICKERS define to turn if off. Thia is related to the Unity Cloud bug which is not yet fixed.
